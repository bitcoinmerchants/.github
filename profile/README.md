The Bitcoin Merchant Community (BMC) is an open and global community of merchants who are enthusiastic about accepting bitcoin for payments, particularly as a way to defeat 3% credit card fees. 

This GitHub organization contains the open-source materials the BMC is sharing with the world. It includes: 

- The website code
- Marketing assets

Please raise issues to contribute feedback and new ideas. We especially like hearing from new merchants.
